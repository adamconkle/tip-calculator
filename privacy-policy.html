    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last Updated: 11/29/25<!-- Insert date here, e.g. March 1, 2025 --></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Mint Tipper</strong> (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;)
      handles information when you use the Mint Tipper mobile application and website.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Mint Tipper is a simple tip calculation tool. We designed it to work with as little
      data as possible. The mobile app does not require you to create an account or
      provide personal information to use its core features.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information Collected by the Mobile App</h2>
    <p>
      The Mint Tipper mobile app does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit
      personal data such as your name, email address, payment details, or location.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bill amounts and tip percentages you enter are processed locally on your
      device for calculation purposes only and are not sent to our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Information Collected by the Website</h2>
    <p>
      If you visit the Mint Tipper website, standard web server logs may automatically
      record basic technical information, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your IP address</li>
      <li>Browser type and version</li>
      <li>Pages visited and time of visit</li>
      <li>Referring website or link</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This type of information is typically used in aggregate form to understand how
      the website is used and to maintain and improve the service.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      Mint Tipper may use basic analytics tools or cookies on the website to better
      understand usage patterns and improve the experience. These tools generally
      collect aggregated, non-personally identifying information such as page views,
      approximate location, and device type.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can usually control or block cookies through your browser settings. Note
      that disabling cookies may affect how some parts of the site function.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>
      The app and website may contain links to third-party websites (for example,
      legal pages, support pages, or other resources). We are not responsible for
      the privacy practices or content of those third-party sites. We encourage you
      to review their privacy policies before providing any information.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Mint Tipper is not specifically directed to children under the age of 13. We do
      not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a
      child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can
      investigate and take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect any information associated with the
      Mint Tipper website. However, no method of transmission over the internet or
      method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute
      security.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
      Since the mobile app does not collect personal data, there is no account or
      profile to delete. If you no longer wish to use Mint Tipper, you may uninstall
      the app from your device at any time and stop using the website.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise
      the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app
      or website after changes are posted will constitute your acceptance of those changes.
    </p>
